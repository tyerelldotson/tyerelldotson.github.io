# Launching a Data Science Career in 2025

Being tasked with checking out this podcast, I wasn’t sure what to expect or if I’d even be interested in what it had to offer. But with a quick scroll, I found something that caught my eye, Breaking Into Data Science in 2025. While I’m not necessarily looking to become a data scientist, I was hoping to gain some insight into how to enter the world of data more broadly, and I walked away with some valuable information. I’ll break down my reflection into three parts: the relevancy of data-adjacent roles, the hiring process, and applying information.

The episode starts with a reference to an article I actually read several years ago about the attractiveness of data science roles and whether they still provide value to companies. I was glad to hear that, despite the evolution of AI, data science positions are still very much relevant, though the role has changed. As you’d imagine, AI helps data scientists work more efficiently by writing code, creating reports or documentation, and gathering information or data from different sources. AI hasn’t replaced data-related positions, it’s created more opportunities; but how?In the past, data professionals were often seen as Swiss-army knives with skills across statistics, coding, analysis, and business. Now, AI increases productivity and supports the development of specialists who can maximize their expertise as opposed to the field being exclusively for those with very specific education backgrounds.

The podcast then shifts to what it takes to become a data scientist and how to land a role. The guest shared that it took them six years of interviews before landing their first data scientist job, but along the way they held several analyst positions. What stood out to me was the recognition that while data scientists used to come mostly from math-heavy degrees, today there are master’s and PhD programs dedicated specifically to data, which provides a clearer path into the profession. Still, it’s not just about education. Hard and soft skills matter, like knowing tools such as Python or SQL, being a strong communicator, adapting to change, and working well on a team. I also found it useful that resumes should highlight projects using a structure of what you did, how you did it, and most importantly, what the outcome was. That approach is something I'm very much familiar with since the military drills the same structure into annual evaluations.

Overall, this podcast gave me a clearer picture of how data-related roles are evolving and which technical skills I need to sharpen (Python and SQL are definitely on my list) to stay competitive. Because my background is rooted in the social work, the soft skills are already something that I've mastered and I think will serve me well as I enter the field. It was also encouraging to hear AI framed as a tool to use, rather than something to fear. I left the podcast motivated and plan to adopt the 10–20% rule, meaning that 10 to 20% of my job should always be about learning something new.
